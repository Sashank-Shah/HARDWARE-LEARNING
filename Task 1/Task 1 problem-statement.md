## Hello Everyone , we hope after going to all of those tutorials provided in the readme file you're familiar with how to code and use an arduino ide.So if we start with the inbuilt blinking an led it won't be fun.So that's why we bring you your very first arduino project that will be easy as well as useful in your day-to-day life.

## Task description:
* There are different types of thermometers available for different purposes. The most commonly found thermometer is a medical or clinical thermometer, which is a mercury in     glass type thermometer.

* They are used to measure the temperature of human body and is an example of an analogue thermometer. Now a days, the use of digital thermometers is increasing as they are     accurate and safe to use.

* In this project, an Arduino based digital thermometer is designed that can be used to monitor the temperature of room.
